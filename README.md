# ff4s

A purely functional web frontend framework for [Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/).

Based on [Snabbdom](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom), [Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/), [Cats-Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/), [FS2](https://fs2.io/), [Scala DOM Types](https://github.com/raquo/scala-dom-types).

Heavily inspired by [Outwatch](https://github.com/outwatch/outwatch).

See the `examples` folder for commented code examples.

To run an example locally, at the sbt prompt change to the `examples` project, then run `dev`.

CAVEAT: This is very much work in progress!
